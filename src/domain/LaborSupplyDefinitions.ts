 * every player count), so each entry in `slots` is one physical octagon and
 * its value is the *minimum* player count at which that slot is in play. Slots
 * whose threshold exceeds the smallest supported count are badged ("3+"/"4+")
 * rather than printed on a separate board.
 *
 * Supply must be monotonic: the live worker count at any tier only grows (or
 * holds) as players are added — otherwise a single printed board can't
 * represent it. Author each `slots` array cheapest-threshold first.

 * monotonic — more players only ever unlock more workers. Hand-edit thresholds
