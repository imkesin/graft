 * One column on a fruit's demand track: a price/demand level (`gold` paid,

 * stack of interchangeable crate slots. The board is printed once (the superset
 * of every player count), so each entry in `slots` is one physical crate slot,
 * vertically stacked within the column, and its value is the *minimum* player
 * count at which that crate is in play. Crates above the smallest supported
 * count are badged ("3+"/"4+") rather than printed on a separate board.
 *
 * Supply must be monotonic: a column's live crate count only grows (or holds)
 * as players are added. Author each `slots` array cheapest-threshold first (the
 * base crate leads), so the base sits at the bottom of the printed stack.
