/**
 * A Labor Market slot a worker token drops into: a 12x12 card-unit footprint
 * with a stone rim, shaped as a regular octagon — a square with its corners
 * clipped at 45°, so it fills the box (touching all four edges) with no stretch.
 *
 * A large, faint brown "W" is stamped in the middle (same idea as FruitCrateSlot's
 * initial): pale enough to sit under a placed token, but enough to identify the
 * slot — and it survives a black-and-white playtest print.
 *
 * An optional `badge` (e.g. "3+") replaces that "W" with the player-count
 * threshold, marking slots that only come into play at higher player counts so
 * one board serves every count. It reuses the W's faint colour and centring —
 * just a smaller font to fit the two glyphs — so it reads as the same stamp.
 *
 * Drawn as inline SVG so it stays print-crisp and scales with `--u`.
